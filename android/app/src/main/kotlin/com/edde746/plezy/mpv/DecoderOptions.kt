/**
 * The session-owned `vd-lavc-o` list.
 *
 * mpv exposes the decoder's AVOptions as one key=value list with no append
 * form through the property interface, so every writer replaces the whole
 * list. Three writers exist: the session's own keys (`ndk_codec`, `async`,
 * `priority`, the per-file Dolby Vision routing and stream rate), the
 * per-file updates to those, and the user's custom mpv config line. The list
 * mpv sees is always composed here as the app's keys followed by the user's
 * text: FFmpeg keeps the last duplicate key, so a user entry wins over the
 * app's for that key while every app key the user did not name survives. A
 * raw user write used to discard `async` and the DV routing along with
 * everything else.
