"""Check that every library the built bundle needs from the host is declared.

bundle-libs.sh ships most of what the app links, but deliberately leaves the
graphics stack, the audio stack and the C runtime to the host: those are coupled
to the running compositor, the GPU driver and the kernel, so a bundled copy is
worse than useless. Everything it leaves behind has to be named as a package
dependency instead. Miss one and the loader fails before main() runs - which is
invisible to any amount of reading package metadata, and invisible to CI unless
something derives the requirement from the artifact.

That matters more than it used to. libmpv now travels inside the package instead
of being depended on, because the plane needs the pinned Wayland-enabled build.
The host `mpv` dependency that went away had been quietly providing libva, libdrm
and their friends transitively.

The deb answer is derived, not written down: dpkg owns the authoritative mapping
from a file to the package providing it, so a library that appears in the bundle
cannot slip past by being absent from a list someone forgot to update. rpm and
pacman names cannot be resolved on a Debian-family runner, so those stay
recorded below; their job is to fail loudly when a new library lands and nobody
thought about Fedora and Arch.

Coverage is checked in one direction only. A declared dependency that nothing
links is harmless - it installs a package the user probably has. A linked
library that nothing declares is a broken install, so that is the direction
worth failing on.
