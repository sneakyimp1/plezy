# Download the published flutter-plezy patched Windows engine (DirectComposition
# + resize-wedge fix) and install it into the active Flutter SDK's artifact cache.
#
# Plezy requires this engine on Windows: it honors the FLUTTER_WINDOWS_DCOMP
# environment variable (set in windows/runner/main.cpp) and presents the Flutter
# UI on a topmost DirectComposition visual, so the mpv video window composites
# *beneath* the UI in a single HWND (window capture works, no transparency
# hacks). It also heals the embedder resize-synchronization wedge that leaves
# the window blank when a window manager (e.g. PowerToys FancyZones) resizes it
# around the first frame (flutter/flutter#159630). On a stock engine both are
# absent: the flag is a no-op and compositing breaks.
#
# Used by CI (.github/workflows/build.yml) and by contributors building locally.
# Engine developers who build their own artifacts use swap-engine.ps1 instead.
#
# The flutter tool validates the engine cache by engine.stamp string only (no
# file hashing), so the swap sticks - but `flutter upgrade` /
# `flutter precache --force` silently restore the stock engine; re-run this
# afterwards. Run `flutter precache --windows` once before this script so the
# cache layout and engine.stamp exist.
#
# Usage:
#   flutter precache --windows
#   windows/tool/install-patched-engine.ps1
